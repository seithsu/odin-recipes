    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Thinly sliced potatoes layered with a creamy, garlicky sauce and baked until golden and tender. This comforting side dish is rich, flavorful, and perfect for any meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups milk, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>6 large potatoes, peeled and sliced</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart casserole dish.</li>
      <li>Whisk condensed soup, milk, and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Layer potatoes and onion in the prepared casserole dish. Pour soup mixture over top; it should almost cover potatoes and onion. If it doesn't, add more milk.</li>
      <li>Cover and bake in the preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven until potatoes are tender, about 1 hour, stirring halfway through.</li>
